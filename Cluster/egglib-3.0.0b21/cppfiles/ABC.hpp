    * It is required to set the number of statistics and at least one
    * input file name before performing analysis. The analysis itself
    * consists in several steps. (1) Computation of the threshold, which
    * requires to read through all files and imports statistics. In the
    * process, the standard deviation of all statistics will be
    * calculated and will be available. (2) Computation of Euclidean
    * distances and weights and generation of a second sample file with
    * weights and (non-standardized) statistics with only non-null
    * weights exported. This step requires that the observed statistics
    * have been set (between steps 1 and 2). (3) Local-linear regression
    * using the fit method. While in the previous steps several models
    * can be mixed, in this step a single model can be processed at a
    * time. The output is a simple file with adjusted parameters only.
