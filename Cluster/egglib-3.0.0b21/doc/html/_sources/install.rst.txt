This page describes the installation procedure of this preliminary
release of EggLib 3.

------------
Requirements
------------

EggLib requires Python version 2.7. If you plan to compile EggLib from
source, you'll need the development libraries for your version of
Python. For using functions of the :mod:`.wrappers` module, the
corresponding program must be found in your system and EggLib should be
configured accordingly (see :ref:`paths`).

--------
Download
--------

EggLib now comes as a single Python package (the C++ code of the
underlying library is included in this package).

.. EGGVERSION ..

Packages for the version 3.0.0b21 are available here:

* :package:`source <tar.gz>` (cross-platform, but requiring that you
  have tools to compile Python extension packages)

* :package:`Windows 32 bits <win32-py2.7.zip>` (suitable for modern
  64-bit architectures)

* :package:`MacOSX 64 bits <macosx-py2.7.zip>`

All distributed packages include a ``doc`` directory that contains a
copy of the HTML documentation available from the web site.

See :ref:`releases` for the list of released packages for all previous
versions.

Installation
------------

From source
===========

The installation of the EggLib package is relatively standard. First,
unpack the source package and archive and move to the new directory.
Then, issue the following commands::

    python setup.py build

And (may require administrator/super-user rights)::

    python setup.py install

That that should be it.
The setup script takes standard Python Distutils options (see `<https://docs.python.org/2/install/>`_).
In addition, the following options are available for the build command:

* ``idir=path`` -- specify an include directory.
* ``ldir=path`` -- specify a link directory.
* ``lname=name`` -- specify a library name to link with.
* ``cflag=flag`` -- specify an explicit CFLAG.
* ``lflag=flag`` -- specify an explicit LFLAG.
* ``enable-abc=F`` -- if ``T``, compile the ABC class (requires the GNU
  Scientific Library).

At this point, you probably won't need to use any the above. It is
recommended to leave the ``enable-abc`` option to its default value
(``F``).

Pre-compiled package for Windows
================================

.. EGGVERSION ..

The package contains an interactive installer, named ``egglib-3.0.0b21.win32-py2.7.exe``
for the last version, which can be executed directly and will install
the EggLib package to yout Python distribution.

Pre-compiled package for MacOSX
===============================

.. EGGVERSION ..

The package contains an archive named ``egglib-3.0.0b21.macosx-10.11-intel.tar.gz``.
and a script ``install.py``.

.. EGGVERSION ..

To install, you need to run the following command: ``python install.py egglib-3.0.0b21.macosx-10.11-intel.tar.gz``.

This command requires that you have administration rights.

---------------------------------
Configuring external applications
---------------------------------

If external applications are needed (one is required for every function
of the :mod:`.wrappers` module), they are must be configured. By
default, EggLib will assume that the corresponding programs are absent
and will not attempt to run them. The best way consists in providing the
command allowing to run the programs to the :mod:`!wrappers` module,
which can be done permanently or temporarily. For details, see
:ref:`paths`.

-------
Testing
-------

After installing EggLib, if the following script runs without errors and
prints the right version as well a few nucleotide sequences, EggLib is
probably installed properly::

    import egglib
    print egglib.version
    m = egglib.coalesce.Simulator(1, num_chrom=(6,), theta=8.0)
    a = m.simul()
    print a.to_fasta(mapping='ACGT')
